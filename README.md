AdaptiveKeyboardConfig
======================

This is a Configuration Utility for New ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014) Adaptive Keyboard.
Because Lenovo's official utility does not allow us to customize Adaptive Keyboard for custom applications, we need some app for that purpose.

This is just my first attempt to do it and it may not be the one you want:P

Requirements
----

* Of course, New ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014)
* Windows 7 or later
* [.NET Framework 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) or later. (Normally ThinkPad X1 Carbon already has it)
